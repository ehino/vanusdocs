# MongoDB

This guide contains information to set up a MongoDB Sink in Vanus Connect.

## Introduction

MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL document database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

The MongoDB Sink connector let you insert events into a mongoDB database automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before forwarding events to MongoDB, you must have:

- A [**Vanus Cloud account**](https://cloud.vanus.ai)
- A [**MongoDB account**](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setting up your MongoDB Cluster

1. Log in to your [**MongoDB Account**](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)

2. Click on **Build a Database**①.

7. Run the command below to create a collection and insert values in it.

```
db.<collectionname>.insertMany([
  { name: "John", age: 30 },
  { name: "Jane", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35 }
]);
```

:::note
Substitute `<databasename>` and `<collectionname>` with the names you prefer for your database and collection.
:::

8. Run the **`db.your_collection_name.find()`⑨** command to confirm that your collection has been created with its inserted values.

- **Connection Uri:** The URI to connect MongoDB, view [**Connection String URI Format**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) for more details.
- **Username:** MongoDB username.
- **Password:** MongoDB user's password.
- **Database:** This is the database name, not to be confused with the cluster name.
- **Collection:** Collection Name

### Step 4: Personalize Event Structure

:::note
This is a general instruction on how to personalize your event structure. You can structure your events to suit your specific requirements and create connections for different scenarios.
:::

1. Click on **Display sample events**① for reference and click on **Add More**② to add events.

## Custom Connection

Create your template following the structure of your database, an example:

```json

{
   "inserts": [
      {
        "scenario": "quick-start"
      }
  ]
}
```
